rich emergent dynamics via physics simulation (p2.js)

Mouse Controls

    Left Click: Adds a new ball at the cursor's location. If you drag and release, the ball will be fired in the direction you dragged.
    Right Click: Reverses the direction of the next ball you fire.
    Scroll: Changes the color of the last 10 balls added, or the color of a new ball that is about to be fired.

Keyboard Controls

    y: Toggles gray mask.
    o: Toggles color interaction on/off.
    v: Toggles automatic color change for all balls.
    x: Switches between different color metrics.
    j: Halts all balls.
    r: Reverses the direction of all balls.
    l/k: Doubles/halves the velocity of all balls.
    q: Reverses the direction of the next ball you fire (same as Right Click).
    i: Toggles auto-firing of balls at the current mouse location.
    m: Toggles between random color mode and color cycling mode for new balls.
    g/t: Turns gravity on/off in vertical direction.
    f/h: Turns gravity on/off in horizontal direction.
    p: Saves current state of all balls to a file.
    w: Triggers file input for loading ball data from a file.
